Dear team,

Here is the qualitative feedback for your group assignment.

-----

## Deliverable 1. Codebase

This was a great effort. I particularly appreciated how your `data_extract.py` is written in a fluent and logical way. Generally, everything was done very well and logically.

## Deliverable 2. Presentation

### Part 1 – Explanation of product/service relative to locations

Reviewers' comments:

- _"Well-researched of Australia background context with statistics"_
- _"Product addressing challenges – application to help learn the fundamentals of English with mockups of the application."_

- _"No limitations and assumptions of the dataset. Ie. information may have changed from date of answering census to date."_
- _"Locations were justified with leaflet map but was hard to follow because the map kept moving."_
